trunk (unreleased)
* vhd: always interpret relative paths in parent locators as being relative to
  the current directory of the file containing the locator first, and then search
  the general search path after.
* deltas: handle cases where parent filenames are different strings but refer
  to the same file (e.g. "foo", "./foo")
* vhd: rename Vhd_input.hybrid -> Hybrid_input.raw
* vhd: add Hybrid_input.vhd to output vhd-formatted data
* vhd: fix stream size calculation, so progress reports (bars?) will be more accurate

0.6.4 (2013-11-06)
* vhd: we expect parent locators to have prefix "file://", rather than "file://./"

0.6.3 (2013-11-01)
* vhd: always open parents read/only; add a read/write boolean to openfile

0.6.2 (2013-10-31)
* fixes openfile on 32-bit machines for disks > 4GiB

0.6.1 (2013-10-30)
* raw: use BLKGETSIZE64 to query the size if stat(2) reveals we've been given
  a block device. Otherwise we use a file size of 0 and don't copy anything.

0.6.0 (2013-10-02)
* move CLI tools to vhd-tool repo
* can parse and print XenServer 'batmaps'
* add a vhd search path, for parent locators with relative paths

0.5.1 (2013-09-27)
* cope with vhds with over-size BATs
* respect --prezeroed when streaming into raw format

0.5.0 (2013-09-23)
* new streaming interface supporting both raw and vhd formats
* uses O_DIRECT by default
* added lots of edge-case unit tests
* sparse_dd implementation
* vhd-tool CLI prototype
